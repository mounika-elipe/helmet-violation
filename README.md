# Helmet Violation Detection using YOLOv8 🪖🚦

This project detects whether a two-wheeler rider is wearing a helmet using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It identifies helmet violations in real-time from video input to support traffic safety systems.

## Features
- Helmet and non-helmet detection
- Real-time video processing
- YOLOv8-based object detection
- Supports image and video inputs

## Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files in This Project
- `.pt` files → Trained YOLOv8 models  
- `.mp4 / .avi` → Test videos  
- `.ipynb` → Detection and experimentation notebook  
- `results.csv` → Detection results  

## How It Works
1. Input video/image is given
2. YOLOv8 detects helmet presence
3. Rider is classified as helmet / no-helmet
4. Output is displayed with bounding boxes

## Applications
- Traffic monitoring
- Road safety enforcement
- Smart city surveillance systems

## Future Enhancements
- Number plate detection
- Live CCTV integration
- Violation alert system
